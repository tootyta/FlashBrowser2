# FlashBrowser2
A small browser capable of viewing/displaying pages with embedded flash content.

# How do I use it?
Right now there aren't any packages and official releases, so to run it you'd need to clone the repository and run
```
npm install
```
And then run it with
```
npm start
```
and the browser should open.

# Future Plans?
I plan to implement the capability of importing .swf files to run them as well as packaging the files so that they may be run more easily on all devices.
